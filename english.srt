1
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
Hey, Spike!

2
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,240
It's ready!

3
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,900
I'm just about done myself.
What's cooking?

4
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,880
SPECIAL "beef with bell peppers."
(Qing-jiao-rou-si)

5
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,380
Asimov Solensan.
This is our next target.

6
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,160
Hey, Jet...

7
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,800
He's a high-end of the syndicate
that deals all around the asteroids.

8
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,060
About this Qing-jiao-rou-si...

9
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,570
The guy's name is Asimov Solensan.
Weren't you listening to me?!

10
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,200
You DON'T call a meatless
"beef with bell peppers"...

11
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,070
..."beef with bell peppers"... do you?

12
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,240
Yes, you do.

13
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,540
No, you don't!

14
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,010
You do when you're broke!

15
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,020
What happened to the 1 million woolongs
we got as bounty from that last guy?!

16
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,310
The repair bill for
the plane you wrecked...

17
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,910
...and the repair bill
for the shop you trashed...

18
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,550
...and the medical bill
of the cop you injured...

19
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,120
KILLED ALL THE DOUGH!

20
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,660
Three days ago, there was a shootout
between his group and an enemy syndicate.

21
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,260
He killed his own men and took off.

22
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,500
They say he's hiding
with his woman in Tijuana.

23
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,040
That's a place for nobodies to go.

24
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,240
Despite being a nobody,
he's worth 2.5 million.

25
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,870
Don't feel like it.

26
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,550
Tijuana... The beef there...

27
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,350
...is Really tasty...

28
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,590
"Attention, please.
We will soon arrive at the gate."

29
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,060
"We look forward to serving you again."

30
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,710
Please line up single file at
the tollbooth after clearing the gate.

31
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,510
Please pass by after switching
the credit sensors to debit mode.

32
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,990
I'll head over after
hitting the cops for clues.

33
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,900
Then I'll try seeing old man Bull.

34
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,270
Can you trust that old guy?

35
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,100
Such an easygoing song.

36
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,530
THIEF!

37
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,170
This again? Goddamn son of a bitch!

38
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,140
Man, you're totally ripping me off,
but do ya realize...

39
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,540
...the reason you can
live here is because...

40
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,450
...I dug that gate with
all my might, ya hear?

41
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,710
This again.
You always say that when you lose.

42
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,050
We all dug the gate together, remember?

43
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,750
That we did.
We dug like there was no tomorrow...

44
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,260
Goddamn idiot son of a bitch!

45
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,040
Gimme a beer.

46
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,670
And I'll have a Bloody Mary.

47
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,980
I got vodka, but unfortunately
I'm out of tomato juice.

48
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,110
I'm sure there's ONE CAN
in the back room...

49
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,390
I'll take a look.

50
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,170
Top-notch "RED-EYE."

51
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,800
You'd know, as a buyer, right?

52
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,670
Can it be... "BLOODY-EYE"?

53
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,880
Prove to me that it's the real thing.

54
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,380
Keep those eyes open!

55
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,340
This is dandy,
but you got anything to eat?

56
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,160
I see...

57
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,830
The red-eyed coyote will appear
at the north end of town.

58
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,890
That is what I see.

59
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,960
A red-eyed coyote, huh...

60
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,600
You, "Swimming Bird."

61
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,000
You shall meet a woman.

62
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,980
You shall be targeted
by that woman...

63
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,270
And then... death.

64
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,970
Again. I see.

65
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,380
"Again"?

66
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,620
I've already died once.
Got killed by a woman.

67
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,820
You take women too lightly.

68
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,850
Catch ya later.

69
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,490
May he be blessed by Wakan tanka.

70
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,340
Presidente?
I'll have a glass on the house.

71
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,110
Damn. Asimov sure lost his head.

72
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:48,460
No shit. We gotta do something
before the cops start moving.

73
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,430
Ya wanna leave it up to the cops?

74
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,950
He IS using those eye drops.
There's no way we can win.

75
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,630
I'm tellin' ya, we got nothin' if
we don't get that "BLOODY-EYE" back.

76
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,900
But, man!

77
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,330
Hey.

78
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,600
Can you give me the specifics?

79
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,580
Man, I'm hungry...

80
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,020
You, too?

81
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,130
It's better to leave the water running.

82
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,270
Or it'll clog.

83
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,690
Oh, I'm sorry!

84
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,330
Thank you...

85
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,170
Um...

86
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,600
...I'f soffy.

87
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,740
Ew! I don't want that anymore!
You can have it!

88
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,080
Lukfy!

89
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,760
I'm really sorry, honest.

90
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,730
Felt like my stomach was
going to be glued to my back.

91
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,860
Nice fighter.

92
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,370
It's an old model.

93
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,100
She's been with me for over ten years.

94
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,630
Looks like you've gotten
a lot of use out of it.

95
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,440
I travel around a lot.

96
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm actually a wandering performer.

97
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,680
I can't tell if you're
for real or just joking.

98
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,310
A lot of people say that about me.

99
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,580
Been to Mars yet?

100
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,520
I was born on Mars.

101
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,990
They have everything there.

102
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,730
Unlike here, Mars has lots
of people, lots of things...

103
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,570
They must live happily there.

104
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,540
Only the rich.

105
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,160
Then I'm sure we'll be happy there.

106
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,480
You planning on escaping to Mars?

107
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,780
Running away...
but how far can you go?

108
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,340
Who are you?

109
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,510
An old-fashioned cowboy.

110
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,720
A bounty hunter?

111
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,350
Good call.

112
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,250
You're not going to catch us?

113
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,990
Your buddy seems to be pretty ill.

114
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,430
I don't deal with weakened nobodies.

115
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,900
Wise decision.

116
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,900
YOU are the nobody!

117
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,340
Asimov! That's enough!

118
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,090
Adios, cowboy.

119
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,570
Why did you stop me?

120
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,710
I coulda killed him in one second.

121
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,380
You're tired.
If you do this anymore...

122
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,880
He was young and attractive.

123
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,380
I was waiting so long for
you to come pick me up.

124
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,850
I can finally escape the
low life I've had here.

125
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,500
I can finally live happily on Mars...

126
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,550
A nap. How peaceful.

127
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,210
I had a good dream.

128
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,150
That's great.

129
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,990
Then you can see the rest of
that dream on the Bebop.

130
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm giving up on this one.

131
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,430
It's impossible to catch him.

132
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,720
There's no way we can win.

133
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,630
When Asimov left his syndicate,
he snuck something out with him.

134
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:02,100
The top-end stuff of all the illegal
eye drops that the syndicate makes.

135
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,580
He took off with all of the drops,
so the group is in a mess.

136
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,810
They wanna catch him,
but all they get back are corpses.

137
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,040
Because Asimov is using it...

138
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,480
The eye drops known as "BLOODY-EYE."

139
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,850
They're planning on going to Mars.

140
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,880
Mars?

141
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,950
But before that, they'll sell THIS off.

142
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,020
Hmm? That's...

143
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,290
I grabbed it from his breast pocket.

144
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,590
You... met him?

145
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,260
A nightmare.

146
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,930
He got you?

147
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,100
The red-eyed coyote will supposedly
appear at the north end of town.

148
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,160
This again? Goddamn son of a bitch!

149
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,570
Man, you're totally rippin' me off, but do
ya realize the reason you can eat well...

150
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,270
...around here is because I cultivated
the land with my buddies, ya hear?

151
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,540
Yeah, and that's us.

152
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,270
That we did...

153
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,010
We planted seeds like
there was no tomorrow...

154
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,310
You were always planting "seeds"
of a different kind, though!

155
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,990
You have any Bloody Marys?

156
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,160
I only got beer.

157
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,100
I've got tomato juice.

158
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,190
How much?

159
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,330
300,000 woolongs.
I got 50 packs.

160
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,470
15 million woolongs, eh?

161
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,410
I'm in a hurry. I'll find others
if you don't want it.

162
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,900
Show me.

163
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,810
Lookin' for this?

164
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,750
Hey, do you know what YOU are worth?

165
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,850
What?

166
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,830
Only 2.5 million woolongs.

167
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,190
You're such a cheap guy.

168
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,720
Long time no see.

169
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,570
Since when are you a buyer?
Did you give up on bounty hunting?

170
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,200
No thrill in cheap bounties.

171
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,500
Looks like you do better as a thief.

172
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,270
Give it back.

173
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,580
Sure I will.

174
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,670
I owe you one!

175
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,890
You trust your eyes too much!
You're not a chameleon!

176
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,060
You can't see everywhere all at once!

177
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,560
Let's go!

178
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,520
That way!

179
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,860
That way! That way!

180
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
What the hell are you?!

181
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,600
Don't move!

182
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,830
All right, stay still!

183
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,740
IDIOT!

184
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,110
We're doomed if these break!
Be more careful!

185
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,970
Sorry to keep you waiting.

186
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,740
You're late, Jet!

187
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,640
Oh...

188
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,670
...shit!

189
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,540
Asimov.

190
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,950
Stop! Doing any more is insane!
Don't do it!

191
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,000
We can't run anymore...

192
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,370
There's no way we can get away...

193
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,560
Adios...

194
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,380
Hey, Spike, it's ready!

195
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,280
It's ready.

196
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,750
What's cooking?

197
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,180
SPECIAL "beef with bell peppers."

198
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,780
Aishiteta to nageku niwa
Too much time has passed by...

199
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:01,120
Amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
...to lament that we were deeply in love.

200
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,820
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart...

201
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:13,560
Iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
...cannot heal all the tears in it.

202
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:22,810
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

203
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,820
The real folk blues.

204
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:36,230
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

205
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:43,860
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta
Sitting in muddy water...

206
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,360
Jinsei mo waruku wa nai
...isn't such a bad life...

207
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:57,280
Ichido kiri de owaru nara
...if it ends after the first time...

208
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,970
Well, and so this program
is finally under way.

209
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,300
What's the meaning of all this?

210
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,640
Next week, we're completely changing
gears to show an anime for all ages.

211
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,170
Was it that kind of a story?

212
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,370
- Cheerful animals wreak havoc all over!
- WHAT?!

213
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,340
But Dr. Doolittle WON'T
be making an appearance.

214
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,340
From little kids to the elderly,
if you love animals...

215
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,980
Hey, hold on now, Spike!

216
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,750
Everyone gather around
and watch the show!

217
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,780
Is it all right to
say stuff like that?!

218
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,050
I'm not responsible for anything!

219
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,650
But there is one favor
to ask right now.

220
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,850
Good little kids should sit far
from the TV when watching the show.

221
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,660
Come on...

222
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,690
Stand back about a kilometer.

223
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,020
That's TOO far.

224
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,150
800 meters then?
